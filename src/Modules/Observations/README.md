# Observations Module

The Observations module is a core component of the MAPP (Monitoring and Assessment for Preschool Programs) system that enables teachers to record, classify, and analyze child development observations using evidence-based assessment frameworks.

## Overview

This module provides a comprehensive system for documenting child development through structured observations that combine formal classification with flexible tagging capabilities.

## Architecture

The module follows **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and **Clean Architecture** principles:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Domain/                 # Core business logic and entities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Application/           # Use cases and application services  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Infrastructure/        # Data access and external services
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Tests/                # Unit and integration tests
```

## Core Entities

### üìä Classification System (Reference Data)

- **`ObservationDomain`**: Development areas (Physical, Social-Emotional, Cognitive, Language)
- **`ObservationAttribute`**: Specific skills within domains (e.g., "Uses large muscles for movement")
- **`ProgressionPoint`**: Rating levels (Emerging, Developing, Secure) with point values

### üìù Observation Data

- **`Observation`**: Main aggregate root containing observation details and classifications
- **`ObservationArtifact`**: Media attachments (photos, videos, audio)
- **`Tag`**: Flexible labeling system for custom categorization

## Tag System

### Purpose

Tags provide **flexible labeling and categorization** beyond the formal classification system, allowing teachers to add custom labels that complement the structured domain/attribute/progression point framework.

### Tag Implementation

Tags are implemented as **value objects** with the following characteristics:

- **Case-insensitive**: "Art-Activity" equals "art-activity"
- **Normalized storage**: Stored in lowercase for consistent searching
- **Indexed**: Database indexing on normalized values for fast queries
- **Flexible length**: Up to 100 characters per tag
- **Multiple tags**: Each observation can have multiple tags

### Usage Examples

```csharp
// Adding tags to an observation
observation.AddTag("outdoor-play");
observation.AddTag("breakthrough-moment");
observation.AddTag("gross-motor");

// Setting multiple tags at once
observation.SetTags(new List<string> 
{
    "art-activity",
    "creative-thinker", 
    "portfolio-worthy"
});

// Removing tags
observation.RemoveTag("needs-support");
```
